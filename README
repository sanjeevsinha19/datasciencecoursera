run_analysis.R

1.Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2.Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
3.Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4.Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 

5.From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.


  
This program reads the data from current working directory.

iT reads Test and train data set

 it use librarty library(reshape2) 

getData ( dir, name ) funtion
  get Data functions reads data in cleanDataframe for the files in data directory passed

  Parameter: 
  <dir>- current working directory
  < Name> - name of the subdiurectiry
  
  
  #  create the actual path for sub directory
  dirpath <- file.path(dir, name) 
  
  
  # Read the features table data into cleanData
  # Read the activities list data into cleanData
  # Read the subjects list into cleanData
  # Return the cleanData 


main program:

# Performs the full analysis of both the test and train 
# datasets. Writes a clean dataset to disk. 
  
  # "set  current working directory to data directory"
  
  # Read the "test"data. 
  
 # Read the "train"data. 
  
  # Join the train and test data. 
 
  # Reshape the data. Melting and DaCASTING
  
  long <- melt(finalData, id = c("subject", "activity")) 
  
  wide <- dcast(long, subject + activity ~ variable, mean) 
  
  
  # final Tidyup data keeping wide . 
 
  # final tidy data file will be saved as cleanData.txt
 
  # Save the clean data -cleanData.txt

# use write.table to to save the data
